tea-break: An app that generates periodic alerts to tell the user to take
a break.

Author: Matthew Signorini <matthew.signorini@gmail.com>


The alerts are controlled by two commands:
	enable-alarm		Begin issuing alerts
	disable-alarm		Cease issuing alerts

Presently, alerts are given on the hour, and the frequency and offset into
the hour are not configurable. Providing more flexible timing options will,
however, be the subject of further development.


IMPORTANT:
=================================================
Have you set up existing cron jobs in your own (user) crontab? If the output
of the command "crontab -l" indicates so, then you need to read this. No
crontab for you? In that case you can skip ahead to instalation.

tea-break sets up a cron job in your user crontab to pop up an alert window
every hour, right? But it's not smart about setting up its cron job. It
basically replaces your crontab (in the event that you have existing cron
jobs set up) with a single cron job to run tea-break, obliterating whatever
crontab you had before. If you don't want your existing crontab to go to
magnetic heaven each time you enable-alarm, then you will want to wait
until tea-break is more polite, and preserves existing cron jobs.


INSTALLATION:
=================================================
tea-break is written in Java and Bash shell script, and makes use of the
cron scheduler to issue periodic alerts. This means that it is only
compatible with Unix-like systems, such as Linux, BSD and Mac OSX. There
is currently no Microsoft Windows support, and no intention to port to
Windows. However, if you feel like porting to Windows, do let me know so I
can link others to your project fork.

Compiling the java source code also requires Apache Ant, which can be
obtained via your package manager for Linux/Unix, or can be downloaded
from Oracle for OSX.

To install tea-break, open a terminal and cd to the directory where this
README is located (which should be where you have unpacked the archive
that you downloaded, or where you cloned the repository). Then run the
command:

	sudo ./install.sh

install.sh will compile all the source files by invoking Ant, and will
copy the compiled binaries and command scripts to the appropriate
directories. By default, everything is installed under /usr/local, which
is the standard location for software that is not maintained by the system 
package manager. This prefix is currently not easily re-configurable.
